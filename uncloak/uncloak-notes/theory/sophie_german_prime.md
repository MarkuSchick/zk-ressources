# Sophie German Prime

In [number theory](number_theory "wikilink"), a [prime
number](prime_number "wikilink") _p_ is a
**Sophie Germain prime** if 2*p* + 1 is also prime.
The number 2*p* + 1
associated with a Sophie Germain prime is called a
safe prime. For example, 11 is a Sophie Germain prime and 2 × 11 + 1 = 23 is its associated is its associated safe prime.

Sophie Germain primes and safe primes have
applications in [public key
cryptography](public_key_cryptography "wikilink") and [primality testing](primality_testing "wikilink"). It has been [conjectured](conjecture "wikilink") that there are [infinitely](infinite_set "wikilink") many Sophie Germain primes, but this remains unproven.

## Individual numbers {#individual_numbers}

The first few Sophie Germain primes (those less than 1000) are

`2, 3, 5, 11, 23, 29, 41, 53, 83, 89, 113, 131, 173, 179, 191, 233,
239, 251, 281, 293, 359, 419, 431, 443, 491, 509, 593, 641, 653,
659, 683, 719, 743, 761, 809, 911, 953, \...
`

Hence, the first few safe primes are

`5, 7, 11, 23, 47, 59, 83, 107, 167, 179, 227, 263, 347, 359, 383,
467, 479, 503, 563, 587, 719, 839, 863, 887, 983, 1019, 1187, 1283,
1307, 1319, 1367, 1439, 1487, 1523, 1619, 1823, 1907, \...`

In [cryptography](cryptography "wikilink") much larger Sophie Germain primes like $1,846,389,521,368 + 11^{600}$ are required.
